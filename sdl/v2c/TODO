TODO

- SDL_syswm.h
- SDL_vulkan.h

Presently, nearly all structs, enums and functions are ported from all include
files in SDL, with the following omissions:

- SDL_assert.h, SDL_atomic.h, SDL_bits.h, SDL_endian.h, SDL_log.h, SDL_main.h
  SDL_system.h, are worth considering, but can likely be dropped.
- SDL_config.h and SDL_config_*.h are not needed.
- SDL_copying.h, SDL_name.h, SDL_revision.h, SDL_quit.h, SDL_types.h do not
  export symbols.
- SDL_egl.h, SDL_opengl.h, SDL_opengl_*.h expose symbols that should be
  provided by another binding library.
- SDL_test.h and SDL_test_*.h are not needed.
- SDL_metal.h will not be included.
- #define'd functions and inlined functions. These should be considered in the
  next pass over the source, although they are not as trivial to add.
- Some functions/structs that are system-dependent (syswm, bits, among others).
- #define'd constants that I missed.
